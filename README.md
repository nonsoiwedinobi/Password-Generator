# Password Generator

This challenge is about creating a web application that generates a random password based on user-defined criteria. The application should have a user-friendly interface and should be responsive to different screen sizes. The password can include special characters, and the user can choose from a variety of character types (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters).
